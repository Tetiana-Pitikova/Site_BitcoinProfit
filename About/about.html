					<h2 class="title"> Be Part of Something Big</h2>
					<p><b>You’ve heard of Bitcoin, I’m sure. It’s one of the most popular of the cryptocurrencies out there. People have been trading it for years, and it’s exciting to do. However, it’s often difficult to master it without the right tools and knowledge.</b></p>
					<p>My brother and I are both good at math. He likes creating formulas that make life easier for others. I fell in love with numbers at an early age, so I preferred online trading. Since I’m a risk-taker, it worked out for me, and I did quite well. </p>
					<p>However, I learned the markets and could see variances that made it easier for me to choose the right trades. Most people don’t have unlimited amounts of time, though anyone can learn.</p>
					<p>Still, when my brother came to me and asked me to try something, I did. He’s my brother, and I trust him completely. When he produced this algorithm, I laughed. What was I going to do with it? Skeptical, I used it for a full day and was completely impressed with the results.</p>
					<p>We decided to create an entire website around it and help others trade without having experience.</p>
