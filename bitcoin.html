            <div class="acor-container">    
                <div class="acor-item">
                    <input type="checkbox" name="chacor" id="chacor1"/>
                    <label for="chacor1">What is Bitcoin? </label>
                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>Cryptocurrency is electronic money, and Bitcoin is one of many out there. With crypto, you can control how it’s made, hide the user’s identity, and protect transactions. In a sense, it’s like cash because cash transactions aren’t noted by a person’s name, and you can’t control it (though the government does). </p>
						<p>Bitcoin is the first-ever crypto, and it was widely adopted as a way to buy things and trades. It had to be created by someone, and that person or group is Satoshi Nakamoto. The developer’s gender isn’t known, and it could be an entire group of people. Before Bitcoin became popular, Nakamoto left the grid.</p>
						<p>The government creates currency, so it owns it. In fact, the government could prevent you from getting access to your funds in an emergency. It can also freeze your accounts for various reasons. </p>
						<p>With Bitcoin, that can’t happen because the government doesn’t own it. In fact, no one ‘owns’ the Bitcoin software and structure. </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <input type="checkbox" name="chacor" id="chacor2" />
                    <label for="chacor2">How Does It All Work? </label>
                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>Since there isn’t a centralized bank to hold the Bitcoins, what happens? How does it work? Primarily, Bitcoin allows a person to send money directly to someone else, which is called a peer-to-peer network. You don’t need a third-party, such as a bank, to process the transaction.</p>
						<p>It’s more efficient this way. Plus, each transaction is verified and recorded in the Blockchain, which is a digital and public record. Of course, no personal information is used, so it’s hard to decipher who sends what to whom. That way, a group or single person can’t falsify or manipulate data. The transactions are permanent and provide more transparency and security.</p>
						<p>However, with the use of auto-trading software, the broker is there to handle the transaction. The Bitcoin Profit software finds appropriate trades, but the broker sets it all up and deals with the money. That way, everything is legal and fair to everyone involved.</p>
                    </div>

                    <input type="checkbox" name="chacor" id="chacor3" />
                    <label for="chacor3">Why Invest in Bitcoin Right Now? </label>
                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>It’s not going anywhere, so Bitcoin is a popular tradeable asset. Everyone agrees that it’s a liquid investment because it’s allowed throughout the world. With that said, there are risks, but it’s also possible to see returns. </p>
						<p>There’s less risk of inflation, too. The government isn’t involved, so Bitcoin is actually immune to inflation. With the infinite Blockchain system, crypto can’t lose its value.</p>

                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>No, it’s not too late! Bitcoin is nowhere close to its market cap, so there is still plenty to go around. Nevertheless, if you don’t have knowledge and skill, it can be easy to make a mistake. That’s why Bitcoin Profit is so popular; we do the work for you, and you can trade like a pro.</p>

                    <label for="chacor5">Why Is It Better to Use Bitcoin Instead of My Country’s Currency? </label>
                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>There are various reasons to use Bitcoins instead of money, and they include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Decentralized and digital – You can exchange and trade Bitcoins without an intermediary to save money and be more secure. </li>
								<li>Less volatility – Bitcoin is accepted globally and can be less volatile than money. </li>
								<li>Keep track of it – You can’t keep track of traditional currency (cash), but with the Blockchain, you can with cryptocurrency. Each transaction of Bitcoin is permanent and public.</li>
								<li>No conversion fees – Since Bitcoin is recognized throughout the world, there aren’t conversion processes and costs to deal with.</li>
								<li>No duplication – You can’t duplicate a Bitcoin because from the time it takes to make the transaction until it gets on the Blockchain, those Bitcoins are held in escrow, and no one can use them.</li>
							</ul>
